## Reporting a Vulnerability

Hi, this project is intended for use in my personal Kubernetes home lab. If you spot any vulnerabilities, please feel free to [contact me](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=siutsin) â€” much appreciated.

If you happen to be around London, UK, I would be glad to meet you personally to say thank you, and hopefully buy you a few drinks or coffee.
