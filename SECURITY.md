## Reporting a Vulnerability

Hi, this project is intended for use in my personal Kubernetes home lab. If you spot any vulnerabilities, please feel free to [contact me](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=B5523C06213E516653CAD6344F5807ABAD36FF00) â€” much appreciated.

If you happen to be around London, UK, I would be glad to meet you personally to say thank you, and hopefully buy you a few drinks or coffee.
