# plugin-barman-cloud

The manifest YAMLs are copied and split from the [CloudNativePG plugin-barman-cloud manifest][manifest-url].

## Why

As of this release, there is no official Helm chart published for plugin-barman-cloud by the upstream project. Therefore, this chart is
generated by splitting the official manifest from the release assets. For more details, see the upstream issue:
[cloudnative-pg/plugin-barman-cloud#351](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/plugin-barman-cloud/issues/351).

[manifest-url]: https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/plugin-barman-cloud/releases/download/v0.5.0/manifest.yaml

```shell
make
```
